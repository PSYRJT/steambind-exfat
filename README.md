# Steam exFAT Bind

Run Steam games directly from an **exFAT external SSD** on Linux with Proton support.  
This script solves the issue where Steam can't create `compatdata` (Proton prefixes) on exFAT because it doesn't support Linux symlinks or permissions.

Instead, it redirects all Proton prefixes into your Linux home (Btrfs/Ext4/etc.) and bind-mounts them back into the SSD's `SteamLibrary` so Steam sees everything as native.

---

## 🚀 Features

- • Works with **exFAT SSDs** shared between Linux, Windows, and macOS
- • Keeps Proton prefixes (`compatdata`) safe in your Linux home
- • Seamless Steam integration — games run as if installed natively
- • Avoids "Device or resource busy" errors
- • Plug-and-play style: run one command after mounting your SSD

## 📦 Requirements

- • Linux (tested on Arch / CachyOS, should work on most distros)
- • `rsync` and `udisks2` (usually preinstalled); for GUI: `zenity`
- • Steam installed with Proton enabled

## ⚙️ Setup

### 1. Clone repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PSYRJT/steam-exfat-bind.git
cd steam-exfat-bind
```

### 2. Make script executable

```bash
chmod +x steambind.sh
```

### 2.5. Replace yourusername and yourSSD with own names

### 3. Optional: Add alias (Fish shell example)

Edit `~/.config/fish/config.fish`:

```fish
alias steambind="~/steam-exfat-bind/steambind.sh"
```

Reload config:

```bash
source ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```

## 🖥️ Usage

1. Mount your SSD (exFAT won't auto-mount on some distros):

```bash
udisksctl mount -b /dev/sdX1
```

(replace `/dev/sdX1` with your SSD partition — e.g. `/dev/sdb1`)
*or just mount using DE file manager

2. Run the bind script (CLI):

```bash
steambind
```

3. Optional GUI:

```bash
./steambind-gui.sh
```

The GUI lets you bind, unbind, or dry-run, and optionally pick a Steam library path. If not specified, the script auto-detects common library locations like `/run/media/$USER/*/SteamLibrary/steamapps`.

## 🔍 How It Works

- • Proton prefixes (`compatdata`) normally live inside each Steam library.
- • exFAT cannot handle symlinks/permissions, so Steam fails.
- • This script:
  - i. Creates a safe prefix folder inside Linux home (`~/SteamPrefixes/compatdata` by default; configurable via `--prefix`)
  - ii. Moves/merges any existing compatdata into it (preserving existing files in home)
  - iii. Cleans the SSD's `compatdata` folder (empties contents)
  - iv. Bind-mounts the home folder back into the SSD so Steam is happy

### CLI options (advanced)

```bash
./steambind.sh [--library PATH] [--prefix PATH] [--unbind] [-n|--dry-run]
```

- `--library PATH`: path to `steamapps` directory (auto-detected if omitted)
- `--prefix PATH`: compatdata storage in Linux file system (default `~/SteamPrefixes/compatdata`)
- `--unbind`: unmount the bind at `steamapps/compatdata` (no data loss)
- `-n, --dry-run`: show actions without changing anything

Environment variables: `STEAM_LIBRARY`, `STEAM_PREFIX_HOME`.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

- • **Game won't launch after reboot** → Just re-run `steambind` after mounting the SSD.
- • **Steam still crashes** → Ensure no leftover `compatdata` on SSD, clear it and retry.
- • **SSD not auto-detected** → Use `lsblk` to check the partition and mount manually with `udisksctl`.

## 🙏 Acknowledgements

I don't have real coding skills — this script is the result of a lot of trial, error, and help from ChatGPT. It's the closest solution I've found that actually works for running Steam Proton games from an exFAT external SSD.

If you do have real coding skills and can improve this project, please feel free to make a pull request. Things like auto-detecting SSDs, a GUI solution, handling multiple libraries, or making it more "plug-and-play" would be amazing.
